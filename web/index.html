        <h3>Ugali from Western</h3>
        <!--<p style="color: green;" > this is a form of inline CSS. In an inline, it has an attribute(style) and a value(color green).-->
        <p class="block">
            The first food i'll blog about is ugali. It's pretty easy to make and there's nothing big about it on travel.
            It's very basic and there's nothing to blog about.
            The first destination i'll blog about is Western. This is where the biggest percentage of ugali is made.
            Most of the people work in sophicticated stalls called 'kisiagi' where the flour is made.
            Not everyone can survive in these areas but then that's why not everyone lives in Western.
            
        </p>
        <h3>Pilau from Coast</h3>
        <p class="block">The second food i'll blog about is pilau. It's pretty easy to make and it's loved a lot by most people.
            The main destination of origin is Coast. This is where the biggest percentage of pilau is made.
            The people of Coast are Waswahili and the main ingredient of the food is some brown dust called masala. 
            Pilau from Coast has a very distinctive taste and it also comes with meat! It is also a big part of Hindi culture but it's called biryani there.
            Unlike ugali, it doesn't require flour, it doesn't require someone to go to the kisiagi and it tastes much better.
        </p><!--Title,Headings,Paragraphs are in-line tags. They don't carry other tags within them but they can associate with each other.-->
        <h3>Mangoes from Macha</h3>
        <p class="block">Next, we have mangoes from Macha. They are really sweet and really cheap when they are in season. The only disadvantage is that they sometimes have worms in the seeds. 
            Depending on how one was raised, some people can eat them with the worms or not. It really doesn't matter anyway as there's always more mangoes to eat on the tree.
            Macha is Machakos where Kambas live. They love all things yellow thus they are also really big on bananas as well.
            Apart from the fruits, Macha is not a holiday destination as it's mostly dry like a desert.
